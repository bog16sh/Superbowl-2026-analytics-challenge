# Superbowl-2026-analytics-challenge
Collecting keywords from X data, preparing the dataset, analyzing the success of Super Bowl ads, creating data visualizations, infographics and whitepaper. 

My goal was to accomplish this using AI — essentially acting as a manager of AI to complete the project, since this is likely the future of data analytics. It may not look perfect, but that was not the objective. The real goal was to practice managing AI effectively.
I truly believe that human input is essential to refine and improve what AI produces. Humans still need to finalize and polish the output to make it more compelling and visually appealing. For example, the infographics look somewhat rough, and AI was not able to fully create a clean, well-structured visual story.
Overall, it took me around two hours to complete the project using AI, whereas it likely would have taken me the entire day to do it on my own. It was a great practice for me of managing AI tools in real world project
